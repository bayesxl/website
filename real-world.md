Mike has been awarded grants of total value £10.6M since his appointment in 2012.
He is the Director of the [AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/), which, in 2019, received £5M from EPRSC and another £11M in pledges (£5M in cash) from non-academic partners.
Mike is also the co-founder of [Mind Foundry](https://www.mindfoundry.ai/).

## [Dyson,](https://www.dyson.co.uk) Domestic Robots (2016–21)

We are developing Bayesian methods to improve the planning of a domestic robot.
We'll say more when we can!

## [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/en-gb.html) & [Nesta,](https://www.nesta.org.uk/) the future of skills (2016–17)

Studying the future of employment is critical in guiding investment and training policies.
We developed a novel methodology for predicting the demand for work and skills in the US and UK economies in 2030, by combining the expertise of humans with Bayesian machine learning.
Our methodology gave us a list of occupations likely to become more important – and a list of those that may disappear. 
In addition, we identified the skills, knowledge types, and abilities that will be most likely experience growth and decline.

## [OCI,](https://www.oci.co.kr/eng/) Decentralised Solar and Energy Storage Systems (2015–17) 

Machine learning will play a central role in delivering and storing energy in future. 

To make best use of renewable energy generation, which is intermittent, accurate forecasting is essential. 
We built Bayesian algorithms to forecast the supply of energy from a network of solar panels – and to forecast the demand for their energy. 
We also used machine learning to deliver an decentralised management scheme for the electrical batteries co-located with our renewable energy generation.
