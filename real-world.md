## [Dyson,](https://www.dyson.co.uk) Domestic Robots (2016–21)

We are developing optimisation methods to improve the planning of a domestic robot.

## [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/en-gb.html) & [Nesta,](https://www.nesta.org.uk/) the future of skills (2016–17)

Studying the future of employment is critical in guiding investment and training policies.
We developed a novel methodology for predicting the demand for work and skills in the US and UK economies in 2030, by combining the expertise of humans with Bayesian machine learning.
