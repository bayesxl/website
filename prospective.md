## Join the BXL

The BXL is always accepting applications from those who share our [vision and values]().
As the BXL receives a large number of applications, it is important that you read and follow all appropriate instructions below carefully.

Firstly, if you are following a formal application process (for a place as a student or postdoctoral researcher), *there is no need to make contact independent of your application.*
In fact, your *unnecessarily* writing in advance will be held against you.
That said, please do feel free to ask crisp questions where helpful.

If you do write, for all applications, please do the following.

1. Answer, in <300 words (there is absolutely no need to use them all), the following questions.
        * Why the BXL? 
        * What is the match between your background and interests and the BXL?
2. Please include in the subject line of your email `[BXL application]` and which application you are making.
3. Please itemise your questions.
4. Include an academic CV.
5. Send your email to Mike Osborne at <script language="JavaScript">
<!--
document.write('<a href="mailto:' + 'mosb' + '@' + 'robots.ox.ac.uk' + '">');
document.write('mosb' + '@' + 'robots.ox.ac.uk' + '</a>');
//-->

# Prospective graduate students

The BXL belongs to the Department of Engineering Science: please [read all relevant information](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/mpls/engineering-science) about the graduate degrees it offers. 
If you make contact, please be clear about which degree you seek and when you would ideally begin the degree. 

The most important component of your application will be a research proposal.
The proposal is an indication of your ability and inclination to do research (to survey literature, identify open questions and tentatively suggest potential solutions); it serves no other purpose. 
It is not a contractually binding statement of your DPhil project.

So as to fairly assess applications, no detailed feedback will be given (particularly on proposals) ahead of their submission.

# Postdoctoral researchers



# Visitors

The BXL is open to applications from fully-funded independent researchers.

# Interns

The BXL does not usually have the capacity to take on research interns; to do so would be unfair to the existing researchers in the group. 
Please do *not* write about such internships, unless you fall into one of the following categories.

1. You are an existing University of Oxford student, with appropriate internship funding (e.g. through the Engineering Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme).
2. You have been accepted to a DPhil place in the BXL.
3. There is strong evidence that you are a fully independent researcher, and hence that you are a visitor, as detailed above.
