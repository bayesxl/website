## Vision

> We're very very Bayesian, so that our AIs are human-friendly.

### What?

We do _Bayesian_ machine learning.
Bayesians use probability theory to build decision-making AIs.
A Bayesian AI is one that:

1. is comfortable with uncertainty;
2. is transparent, particularly in reporting its confidence;
3. makes good use of all contextual information, beyond just its data.

The Bayesian approach is the oldest of the approaches to AI, dating back to Laplace, who wrote in 1814 that "the theory of probabilities is basically just common sense reduced to calculus".
Calculated common sense is exactly AI.

The BXL is taking Bayes further than ever before.
Numeric algorithms, like optimisers, are essential engines at the heart of all AIs.
We build Bayesian versions of these numeric algorithms; our goal is AIs that are *fully* Bayesian.

### Why? 

Firstly, a Bayesian AI is human-friendly. Its transparency makes it trustworthy. 
benefits from human expertise,
and makes efficient use of the data we label.

Secondly, Bayes has survived more than two-and-a-half centuries of people (unsuccessfully) trying to kill it off. No other approach to AI has proved so useful for so long. 

Thirdly, Bayes is beautiful enough that it might just give a unifying theory for all AI. 

 Bayes has been hindered by numerics; particularly integrators:
1. computationally expensive; and 2. often wrong.

We need to build our own wrappers around BayesOpt and BayesQuad to real problems.


## Values

The ordering of these values is deliberate and important. 

1. **People first.** We treat ourselves and each other with respect and compassion. In particular, we prioritise wellness. We emphasise *team-work.* It's a myth that research emerges from isolated genius rather than from process and teamwork--and that myth costs a whole lot of mental health. We extend our values to all people touched by our research. 
2. **Integrity.** We aim for the highest standards of real scientific rigour and intellectual honesty. Reproducibility is at our core: open-source data and code. Importantly, note that it is more important for us to be correct than to show that Bayes works well. 
3. **Planning.** We plan our research. This produces better, more polished, research and lowers stress and unnecessary overwork. There are a million things we could do; we plan to achieve those that matter most.
4. **Exploration**. We trust ourselves to go where no-one else has. We also entrust the users of our research with the ability to explore on their own. That is, our goal is to deliver solutions that empower people, rather than substitute for them.
