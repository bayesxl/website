## Values

The ordering of these values is deliberate and important. 

1. **People first.** We treat ourselves and each other with respect and compassion. In particular, we prioritise wellness. We emphasise *team-work.* It's a myth that research emerges from isolated genius rather than from process and teamwork--and that myth costs a whole lot of mental health. We extend our values to all people touched by our research. 
2. **Integrity.** We aim for the highest standards of real scientific rigour and intellectual honesty. Reproducibility is at our core: open-source data and code. Importantly, note that it is more important for us to be correct than to show that Bayes works well. 
3. **Planning.** We plan our research. This produces better, more polished, research and lowers stress and unnecessary overwork. There are a million things we could do; we plan to achieve those that matter most.
4. **Exploration**. We trust ourselves to go where no-one else has. We also entrust the users of our research with the ability to explore on their own. That is, our goal is to deliver solutions that empower people, rather than substitute for them.
