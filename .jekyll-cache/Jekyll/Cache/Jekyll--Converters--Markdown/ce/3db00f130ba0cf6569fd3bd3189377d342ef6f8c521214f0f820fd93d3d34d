I":<p>Planets that orbit distant stars stretch our ability to provide accurate and precise measurements: the data that characterises such exoplanets is inherently uncertain. We have been using machine learning, particularly Gaussian processes, to identify the signatures of exoplanets within such difficult data.</p>
